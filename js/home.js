                “I’ll tell you how I feel about school, Jerry: 
                It’s a waste of time. Bunch of people runnin’ around
                bumpin’ into each other, got a guy up front says, 
                ‘Two plus two,’ and the people in the back say, 
                ‘Four.’ Then the bell rings and they give you a 
                carton of milk and a piece of paper that says you 
                can go take a dump or somethin’. I mean, it’s not a 
                place for smart people, Jerry. I know that’s not a 
                popular opinion, but that’s my two cents on the 
                issue.” — Rick
